Parcel comes bundled with a development server. To access, within the parent directory of the project (where Parcel has already been installed), run:
npx parcel <relative path to html file to display>

e.g. npx parcel src/index.html

Then go to http://localhost:1234 to see the rendered HTML. The page will auto-refresh with any changes made.
